# FujitsuTrialTask

This project is a completed trial task.

It is a sub-functionality of the food delivery application, which calculates the delivery fee for food couriers based on regional base fee, vehicle type, and weather conditions.

Weather data for the application is taken from the [ilmateenistus.ee](https://www.ilmateenistus.ee/teenused/ilmainfo/eesti-vaatlusandmed-xml/).

## Bonus tasks

Business rules for base fees and extra fees can be managed through the REST interface.

If the datetime parameter is valued, delivery fee calculations will be done based on business rules and weather conditions, which were valid at the specific time.

## Documentation

Documentation of the code generated by JavaDoc can be found in documentation/index.html.

The REST API documentation generated by Swagger can be found after running the application at http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html.
